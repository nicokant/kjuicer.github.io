<h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Kjuicer Privacy Policy follows the Italian Decree Law 196 / 2003. The Decree Law 196 (June 30th, 2003, Regulations concerning data protection) regulates the public and other subjects&#39; legal protections on the matter of personal data processing.</p>
<p>In accordance to the regulations specified above, data processing at Kjuicer will be inspired by the criterias of legitimacy, transparency, and privacy protection of our users.</p>
<p>In accordance with article 13 of the Decree Law n. 196/2003, we provide the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Personal data will be processed for the purpose of offering a personal account, where users can save or collect their documents and data through Kjuicer, and the re-access them also on other devices. At the moment no other purposes have been planned.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data processing is carried out automatically, but it could also be carried out manually.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data provision from the user is mandatory in order for Kjuicer to technically offer the service, with particular reference to saving documents and data. Refusal to provide such data from the user does not allow the personal account creation.
In the current version, creation of documents in Kjuicer without a personal account is still possible. In the near future this might become impossible, as well as it might become impossibile using the service altogether.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data will not be shared with other entities, other than when technically necessary, and will not be shared. In the case of log in through external websites or services like Google, Facebook or others (a process technically called OAuth): this procedure implies transferring some information from those services/websites to Kjuicer. To carry out such transfer, a specific authorisation will be asked. Data handling of the original set of information is determined by the respective Privacy Policy of the services/websites.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The processing entity is Kjuicer.com Srl, via Ruggero di Lauria, 2 - 20149, Milano (MI), Italy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The person responsible for the treatment is Giampaolo Ferradini, Chief Executive Officer of the company.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The representative in the Italian territory is, again, Giampaolo Ferradini.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In every moment the user can exercise his privacy rights with respect to the processing entity of his personal data, in accordance with the Decree Law 196/2003, article 7, by sending an email to info@kjuicer.com.</p>
