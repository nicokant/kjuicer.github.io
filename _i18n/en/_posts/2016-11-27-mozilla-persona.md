summary: How to access to your Kjuicer account if used Mozilla Persona as authentication method
lang: en
---
## Persona has been shut down

The persona.org services run by Mozilla has been shut down on November 30th 2016. This change affects Kjuicer users that used Mozilla Persona as authentication method.

## How to migrate

In order to regain access to these accounts, an easy migration procedure has been developed. Mozilla Persona users are requested to [set a new password](http://alpha.kjuicer.com/admin/password_reset/) associated with their email address and log in with a regular Kjuicer account.

## Alternatives

Kjuicer currently provides registration and access using the Google OAuth2 authentication method, but we are planning to add new methods and provide better integration between accounts and popular credential providers.

## Support

Please write to [info@kjuicer.com](mailto:info@kjuicer.com) for support.
