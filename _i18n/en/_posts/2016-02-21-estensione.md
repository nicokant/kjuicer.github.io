The Kjuicer Extensions for Chrome and Firefox are finally available at [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kjuicer/kgjcgankonbfhdgpfdbggfifpcabocno) and [Mozilla Marketplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kjuicer/).

The extension can create a cache of (almost) any web page, and allows it to be highlighted with the Kjuicer.
Bear in mind that in order to be able to save the page you need at least a basic Kjuicer account, which is free, and to be logged in.
